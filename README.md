# Hair Day - Madison's Premier Boutique Salon

This one page project is a demonstration of my HTML and CSS skills through the creation of Hair Day, a boutique salon website. 

Hair Day is a stylish and professional website designed for a salon, showcasing a comprehensive understanding of HTML5 and CSS3.

HTML5: For semantic structure and clean markup.

CSS3: For layout, styling, and responsive design.

Media Queries: Breakpoints are used to adjust the layout for different screen sizes.

Flexbox & Grid: Employed for layout structure, centering content, and maintaining consistency across devices.

Buttons: Call-to-action buttons with hover effects that change color and size for a more interactive feel.

Background Overlays: Semi-transparent overlays for banners to make text pop without losing the backgroundâ€™s visual appeal.

Shadows and Borders: Subtle box-shadows and borders for a clean, modern aesthetic without overwhelming the design.
